# Advent of Code 2024 - All solved in Rust

My goal is to learn Rust until Christmas, and the best way to learn a new language is not Duolingo, but learning by doing. So Rust it is.

## Check out my friends repos too!

- [IliHanSoLow](https://github.com/IliHanSoLow/AoC-2024-Rust)

P.S.: can someone please tell [IliHanSoLow](https://github.com/IliHanSoLow/AoC-2024-Rust) to also add a README to his repo? Thank u.
